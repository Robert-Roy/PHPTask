# PHPTask

A todo list application created alongside the Laracasts "How to Build Command-Line Apps" course.

To run, download this repo, then use the LinuxMakeSQLite3.sh or WindowsMakeSQLite3.sh files depending on your OS (MAC users should run the LinuxMakeSQLite3.sh file). These will initialize an empty database.

After that, simply execute the PHPTask file. More usage information is made available by the program itself.
